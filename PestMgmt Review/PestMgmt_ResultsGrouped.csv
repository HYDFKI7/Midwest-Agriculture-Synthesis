When planting date was pooled over seeding rate and seed treatment within each interaction, we observed significant declines in CIPAR (93 MJ m−2) and CumNDVI (6.2) between the early and late planting dates. Examining the planting date ́ seed treatment inter- action showed that CruiserMaxx increased CIPAR and CumNDVI over ApronMaxx and the UTC within the early planting date. Seed treatment did not alter CIPAR or CumNDVI for the mid- and late planting dates. Furthermore, CruiserMaxx within the early planting date increased CIPAR by 104 MJ m−2 and CumNDVI  by 7.1 compared with the UTC in the late planting date. These large increases indicate that maximum CIPAR and CumNDVI were attained by early planting and then increased further by using a fungicide and insecticide seed treatment (CruiserMaxx).
