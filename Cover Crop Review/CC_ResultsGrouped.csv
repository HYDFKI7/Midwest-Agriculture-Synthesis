Thus, when manure was first applied the cover crop plants and roots were physically destroyed in the injection zone and their effectiveness at taking up NO3 from this zone was reduced.

They suggest that the benefits of the cover crop (rye) roots in decreasing soil bulk density (reducing soil compaction) and increasing total porosity were more prominent in the top 10 cm of the soil. At deeper depths (20-60 cm), the influence of rye is no longer felt since soil bulk density and total pore space were higher in rye planted plots as compared to no-rye plots. This is understandable, since most rye roots were concentrated in the 0-10 cm depth. ","935","Soil Pores","Physical"

In fact, the analysis of variance [for 2013] showed that none of the interactions reported in 2012 were present in 2013, suggesting that the interactionsbetween various soil and crop management practices are complex in nature and their effects on soil physical properties may not be easily predictable. In the third year of the study, tillage x cover crop interaction showed that under no-till management, planting rye caused a 3% reduction in bulk density compared with when rye was not planted, suggesting that the improvement of bulk density by cover crop roots is enhanced with no-till management since there was no main effect of cover crop on bulk density.","936","Soil Pores","Physical"
